SONAR
A Sonar system consists an ultrasonic sensor which emits a signal or ultrasound waves through the trigger pin, when these soundwave strikes an object, they return back and are received by the Echo pin. 
Hence the distance of the object from the sensor can be calculated by using the values of speed of sound and duration. The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a servo motor which rotates from 15 to 180 degrees which covers the area.
The presence and distance of the object around the area covered by the sensor can be observed in the Processing IDE.
